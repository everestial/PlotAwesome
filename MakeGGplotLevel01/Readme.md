# A ggplot example 
### In this project I create a data (diameter) for a plant in 4 different treatement groups. I plot diameter across several months as well as diameter changes and use several ggplot methods, i.e geom_point(), geom_line(), geom_errorbar(), theme() etc to create a complex, comprehensive and rich plot.

The script file is available as file **" 	MakeGGplotLevel01.R"**. 

**The "Rmarkdown" of the the analyses is available as HTML output in this link:**
